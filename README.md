<br> `To read more about every service configs, installtion, runing refer to it's readme.md file`
### Architecture:
My demo application is composed of backend and frontend applications developped with MERN Stack technologies.

  application  | Details
  ------------- | -------------
  **Backend application**: | Developed using **NodeJS/EpressJS/** and **MongoDB** to persist my schools and users.   
  **Frontend application** | Developed using **Javascript/ReactJS/Redux** and **react material UI** for application styles.

## fonctional analyse and sequence :

to realise this projet in a goog way, I firtly begin with a functional analysis. within  this ,I define the main process of user interaction with the application. 

### Results :
I could explore results of the developpment of the application by consulting the frontend resulting application or by consulting swagger interface of the backend :<br>
